The data consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables were then divided into several broad categories:Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors, and social factors.

Variable Descriptions
1.	country (Nominal) - the country in which the indicators are from (i.e., United States of America or Congo)
2.	year (Ordinal) - the calendar year the indicators are from (ranging from 2000 to 2015)
3.	status (Nominal) - whether a country is 'Developing' or 'Developed' by WHO standards
4.	life_expectancy (Ratio) - the life expectancy of people in years for a particular country and year
5.	adult_mortality (Ratio) - the adult mortality rate per 1000 population (i.e., number of people dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population); if the rate is 263 then that means 263 people will die out of 1000 between the ages of 15 and 60; another way to think of this is that the chance an individual will die between 15 and 60 is 26.3%
6.	infant_deaths (Ratio) - number of infant deaths per 1000 population; like above, but for infants
7.	alcohol (Ratio) - a country's alcohol consumption rate measured as liters of pure alcohol consumption per capita
8.	percentage_expenditure (Ratio) - expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
9.	hepatitis_b (Ratio) - number of 1-year-olds with Hepatitis B immunization overall 1-year-olds in the population
10.	measles (Ratio) - number of reported Measles cases per 1000 population
11.	BMI (Interval/Ordinal) - average Body Mass Index (BMI) of a country's total population

14.	total_expenditure (Ratio) - government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure
15.	diphtheria (Ratio) - Diphtheria tetanus toxoid, pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate of 1-year-olds

18.	population (Ratio) - population of a country
19.	thinness_1-19_years (Ratio) – the rate of thinness among people aged 10-19 (Note: variable should be renamed to thinness_10-19_years to represent more accurately the variable)
20.	thinness_5-9_years (Ratio) – the rate of thinness among people aged 5-9
21.	income_composition_of_resources (Ratio) - Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
